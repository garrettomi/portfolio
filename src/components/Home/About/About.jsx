                <AboutText text="Hi! My name's Garrett and I'm a Software Engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area living in Tokyo with my wife and newborn son.
                  As a 4th generation Japanese American, I moved to Japan in order to get closer to my ancestral heritage and have now lived here for close to 5 years.
                  In my rare free time apart from programming and parenting, I enjoy cycling around the Tokyo suburbs, drinking good coffee and shopping for denim.
                  Thanks for visiting my page!" />

                <AboutText text="It was during the pandemic while I was still teaching at an international school where I first discovered my passion not just for coding, but for identifying issues and problem-solving through tech.
                  It began with self-studying basic HTML, CSS and Javascript to build static webpages for optimizing classroom organization which transcended into a life-long commitment towards the world of software development." />
